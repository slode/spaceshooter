# SpaceShooter!

This is a space shooter written for pygame. Performs well on an RPi3.

## ECS architecture

The game was rewritten to toy around with the ECS architecture. While not yet feature complete with respect to the previous iteration, what's done so far strongly indicates that the code will end up being simpler and nicer.

## Triton

The game also uses features from the Triton 2d physics module.

## Game modes

TODO:

Head-to-head:
  Two fighters duelling left to right. With arcade like screen-wrap this could be interesting.

PVE single or coop:
  Kill aliens!

## Disclaimer

I don't own the sprites, so if you do, and have any issues with them being
here, let me know and I will take them away.
